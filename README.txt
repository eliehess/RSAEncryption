This program uses 300-bit RSA encryption to convert a text file into (hopefully) gibberish numbers.

Even if an unwanted user obtains the encryption program, it should be pretty close to impossible to decrypt any encrypted messages.

To run, create a file named "input.txt" in the root directory of this program and run Encrypt.java.

The result should be an encrypted file titled "bomb.kgb". Don't let the name confuse you: this file can be read using any text editor.
